Hello, and welcome!
This is just a quick explanation to the songs or the Extra parts you're gonna be seeing!
Don't mind the OtKami X Lex stuff, I just found it funny and saved all the art I couldI have spent many days in the FnF community, and I can say it was amazing, but uh I don't have much time do I? I've tried spending as much time possible. I'm not gonna be deleting my account, and im not gonna be fully leaving. I will still be online on Discord and just a tad bit on itch.io, now, I did really enjoy my stay but everything comes to an end. 
List of my (close) friends/ nice people to me

3. Dice
4. Shift3r
5. Jill
